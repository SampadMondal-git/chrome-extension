# LinkedIn Profile Scraper Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that scrapes LinkedIn profile data and stores it in a backend database. The extension allows users to collect profile information from LinkedIn pages and view the collected data through a popup interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **Profile Data Extraction**: Automatically scrapes LinkedIn profile information including:
  - Name and headline
  - Location
  - Connection count
  - Follower count
  - About section

- **Advanced LinkedIn Engagement (Task 3)**:
  - Add Like Count and Comment Count input fields to the popup UI.
  - Start Engagement button is enabled only when both fields have input.
  - On click, opens LinkedIn feed and automatically likes and comments on posts based on user input (randomized, human-like behavior).
  - Uses generic comments (e.g. "CFBR") for auto-commenting.
  - All Task 3 functions are clearly commented in the code for easy understanding.

- **Data Storage**: Stores collected profile data in a SQLite database via Express.js backend
- **User Interface**: Clean popup interface to view and manage collected profiles
- **Real-time Collection**: Collect data while browsing LinkedIn profiles

## Task 3: Advanced LinkedIn Engagement & Functions

**Task 3 Overview:**
This feature allows you to automate LinkedIn engagement (likes and comments) directly from the extension popup. You specify how many posts to like and comment on, and the extension performs these actions on your behalf with human-like timing and randomized behavior.

**UI Changes:**
- Two new input fields: Like Count and Comment Count
- "Start LinkedIn Engagement" button (enabled only when both fields have values)

**Core Task 3 Functions & Their Purpose:**

### In `popup.js`
- **Like/Comment Input Elements**: DOM references for the Like Count and Comment Count input fields and the Start Engagement button.
- **validateEngagementInputs**: Enables/disables the Start Engagement button based on input validation.
- **Input Event Listeners**: Re-validates the button state whenever the user changes the like/comment counts.
- **Start Engagement Button Handler**: Opens the LinkedIn feed in a new tab, injects the engagement script, and sends the like/comment counts to start the engagement process.

### In `linkedin-engagement.js`
- **engagementConfig**: Tracks how many likes/comments to do, how many are done, and prevents running the script multiple times.
- **genericComments**: List of comments to randomly use for auto-commenting.
- **chrome.runtime.onMessage Listener**: Listens for the "startEngagement" message from the popup, sets up engagementConfig, and starts the engagement process.
- **startEngagementProcess**: Waits for the LinkedIn feed to load, then starts performing the like/comment actions.
- **waitForPageLoad**: Waits until LinkedIn posts are present on the feed before starting engagement.
- **performEngagement**: Main loop that likes/comments on posts up to the user-specified count, scrolling to load more as needed, and randomizing actions to mimic human behavior.
- **getVisiblePosts**: Gets all LinkedIn posts currently visible in the viewport.
- **likePost**: Likes (reacts to) a single post if not already liked, with human-like delays and visual feedback.
- **commentOnPost**: Comments on a post using a random generic comment, with human-like typing and delays.
- **typeWithDelay**: Types text into a comment box with random delays, mimicking human typing.
- **scrollToLoadMore**: Scrolls the page to load more posts when needed.
- **randomDelay**: Utility for random timeouts between actions to avoid detection as a bot.
- **highlightAction**: Highlights a post after like/comment for visual feedback.
- **showCompletionMessage**: Shows a notification when engagement is complete, indicating how many likes/comments were performed.

> **Tip:** All Task 3 functions are clearly marked in the code with comments for easy navigation and understanding.

- `DELETE /api/profiles/:id` - Delete a specific profile

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Collect Profile Data" button shows OK response but no data appears in popup

**Possible Solutions**:
1. Check if the backend server is running on `http://localhost:5000`
2. Verify the popup.js `fetchAndDisplayProfiles()` function is working correctly
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure LinkedIn page has fully loaded before collecting data
5. Verify content.js is properly injecting into LinkedIn pages

**Issue**: Extension not loading or permissions errors

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure all required permissions are granted in `manifest.json`
2. Check that host permissions include LinkedIn domains
3. Reload the extension in Chrome extensions page

**Issue**: Data not being scraped from LinkedIn

**Solutions**:
1. LinkedIn may have updated their page structure
